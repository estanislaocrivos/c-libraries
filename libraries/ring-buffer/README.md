# Ring Buffer 💍

A ring buffer (also known as a circular buffer) is a fixed-size data structure that uses a single, contiguous block of memory as if it were connected end-to-end. It is particularly useful for buffering data streams, such as audio or network packets, where the producer and consumer operate at different rates.
