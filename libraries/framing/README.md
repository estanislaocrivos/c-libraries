# Framing Library ðŸ“š

A simple C library for framing data packets with support for simple frame formats, including start and stop delimiters, payload extraction, and CRC checks.

## Features

- Start and stop delimiters for framing data packets
- Payload extraction from framed data
- CRC-8 checksum for data integrity verification
- Easy-to-use API for framing and deframing data

## What this project taught me

- Understanding of data framing concepts and protocols
- Implementation of CRC algorithms for error detection
- C programming skills, including memory management and pointer manipulation
- Designing a simple and effective API for library usage
- Testing and debugging techniques for low-level data processing
- Documentation practices for open-source libraries
- Version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub
